# Exploratory Data Analysis
## Course Project 1

This is my repository I created for the Coursera course "Exploratory Data Analysis". 

You will find here 4 R scripts which will create PNG files with required plots.

To run scripts:
1. Download them onto your hard drive
2. Create the directory "Data" in the folder where scripts are
3. Download required [data](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/exdata%2Fdata%2Fhousehold_power_consumption.zip) and extract it into Data folder
Note! the scripts will not check if data file exists!
4. Run the scripts

Each script will created one file with plots. The PNG files can be downloaded from the repo as well.
